"""Bias & Citation Integrity Auditor — validates every citation deterministically.

Statutes are checked by exact metadata lookup against the corpus. Case citations
(precedents) are checked by name-token match against the local precedent corpus
first; anything not matched there is put to a Tavily web check so a real case the
small local corpus doesn't hold isn't wrongly branded a fabrication.
